# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation from Scratch

## Overview :-

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm built from scratch using Python. 
KNN is a simple, intuitive, and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

## What I Learned :-

- Understanding how KNN classifies data points based on the closest neighbors.
- Implementing distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) to measure similarity.
- Experimenting with different values of **K** to observe its impact on predictions.
- The importance of data preprocessing and feature scaling for better performance.
